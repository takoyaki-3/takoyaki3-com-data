[Multi-objective Searching on Multimodal Transportation Networks*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10123552)

## Abstract:
Urban transportation involves multiple modes of public transportation such as trains, streetcars, and buses. In Tokyo, timetables are often organized to take into account the connections between different modes of transportation, and transportation between points is assumed to be a multi-modal transportation network. In general, route search services allow users to set multiple objectives, such as the minimum number of transfers and the lowest fare, in addition to the fastest arrival time, and users select routes considering these multiple objective functions. In this study, we propose Trans-Net, which models multimodal transportation networks, and a solution method for multi-objective optimization problems on Trans-Net.
